I am a PhD student at Binghamton University (NY). My research focus is on Machine Learning and Deep Learning and their applications in digital media security such as Steganography/Steganalysis or Watermarking. I also hold a MSc in Computer Science/Machine Learning from Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille (France).
