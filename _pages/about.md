I am passionate about machine intelligence. 

I work as a research engineer at comma.ai where my focus is learning driving agents from data and in an end-to-end fashion.

I hold a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Binghamton University (NY) where I researched digital media security topics such as Steganography/Steganalysis or Watermarking using state-of-the-art Deep Learning and Machine Learning. 

I also hold a MSc in Computer Science/Machine Learning from Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille (France).
