[Mostafa Bouziane](https://github.com/MostafaBouziane) and I ranked 2nd at the annual [DAD Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dad-bankruptcy-prediction-challenge-2018).

The Kaggle consisted in predicting bankrupt compagnies based on 64 features from their financial reports.

This Kaggle's challenge was dealing with unbalanced classes, with different proportions in training and testing set.
