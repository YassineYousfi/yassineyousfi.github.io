[Mostafa Bouziane](https://github.com/MostafaBouziane) and I have published our first [Medium article](https://medium.com/sequential-learning/optimistic-q-learning-b9304d079e11). We talk about Q-Learning and explore the use of an Upper Confidence Bound exploration strategy.

This is more a popular scientific piece where no prior knowledge of Reinforcement Learning is assumed. 

All the codes used for this are available in [this repo](https://github.com/YassineYousfi/Sequential-Learning).
