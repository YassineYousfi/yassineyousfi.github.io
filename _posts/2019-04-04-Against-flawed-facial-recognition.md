I signed a letter calling on Amazon to stop selling flawed facial recognition systems ("Rekognition") to law enforcement until clear regulation are in place.

The letter was written by the Concerned Researchers group and gives ample details about why current flaws in facial analysis and recognition systems are a cause for concern.

Read the letter [here](https://medium.com/@bu64dcjrytwitb8/on-recent-research-auditing-commercial-facial-analysis-technology-19148bda1832) and use the google spreadsheet below if you are concerned about this.
